This page contains a list of guides for lua scripting for RFGR using the RSL. Note that these guides will often skip explaining the syntax of lua. There are already many guides on using lua online so it's better to keep these guides focused on scripting for RFGR.

.. warning:: Lua scripting is not a mature feature. Expect there to be breaking changes as it's continually updated and tweaked. Be sure that you can support and update your mod in case of any breaking changes.
