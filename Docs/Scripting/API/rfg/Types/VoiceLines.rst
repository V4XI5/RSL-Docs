VoiceLines
========================================================
Enum for various preset voice lines. Defined in ``./Core/rfg/VoiceLines.lua``. This is another fairly large enum, with several dozen entries so for now it hasn't been reproduced here to save on time. Please see the mentioned lua file for a list of it's values.
